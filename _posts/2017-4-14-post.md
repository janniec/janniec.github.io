title: Where to Find the Most Strangers in NYC...& tell them I survived Week 1!
---
Week 1 done! Survived.  
Overall impression this week? :kissing:  
A tad overwhelmed but full of hope.   

A few tips to myself in retrospect.  
  - Start the day right. Wake up a 1 hour early & work out...your brain. Every class started with a pair programming challenge. First. Thing. In. The. Morning.  You have to show your peer you don't suck at a basic requirement from the prework.    

  - Stop over-googling. If your mind goes blank and you use google to find the answers, google is a crutch...that your instructors will use to beat you...figuratively...out of respect...and affection? Must be, because once I stopped over-googling, I really started coding.

  - Review! Magically find 1 free hour in your new busy-bootcamp-life and review every night! That way you don't have to sacrifice your weekend. It's super helpful to mentally organize everything Metis threw at us this first week.

## Project 1: NYC subway commuters
Duration: about 1 week  

Objective: The client wants to optomize its the effectiveness of their street team by placing them at the entrances of subway stations with the most relevant foot traffic, " individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology" (like me!).

Data:   
MTA Weekly turnstiles data for 10 weeks of Spring 2016 and 2017 ("turnstile data")
http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html
Geo location information of MTA Station Entrances ("station data")
http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/StationEntrances.csv
Geo location of Colleges and Universities in NYC ("colleges data")
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Colleges-and-Universities/4kym-4xw5/data

Approach: For this project, I worked with my partner, "Magic Maker" Mariya (Shhh. She doesn't know her nickname yet.) We approached the problem through the following steps.
  1. Understand the problem -   
    -There are nearly 400 MTA subway station entrances. So we wanted to prioritize (A) volume of foot traffic, and (B) Proximity to responsive audience.  We made the assumption that people with (or seeking higher education) are more responsive to our client's objective.

  2. Make the data work (Cleaning, Analyzing, Editing, Screaming :scream: ... repeat) -
    We wanted to connect the turnstile data, which tracked the foot traffic, with the stations data, which contained the latitude and longitude of very MTA station. Then compare the turnstile-stations data with colleges data that contained the latitude and longitude of the colleges.  
    We focused on the top 20 stations with the most foot traffic.

  3. Analysis & Recommendations -   
  We analyzed the distance of these 20 stations to the nearest college and the number of colleges within 1 mile of them. (Plots! Plots! Plots!)

  Top left quadrant represents stations with highest foot traffic and closest to the nearest campus:
    - 34 St - Penn Station  
    - Grand Central - 42 St
    - 34 St - Herald Sq
    - 23 St
    - 14 St - Union Sq  

  And, we focused on the number of colleges within 1 mile to each of these 20 stations.

  Top right quadrant represents stations with highest foot traffic that are close to the most campuses (Spoiler! Its the same 5 stations):
    - 34 St - Penn Station  
    - Grand Central - 42 St
    - 34 St - Herald Sq
    - 23 St
    - 14 St - Union Sq

Conclusion to week 1?  
###### "You now know enough about data science to be dangerous." :boom:
(so says our instructors)
