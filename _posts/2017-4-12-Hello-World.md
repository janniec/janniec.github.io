title: A lawyer walks into a bootcamp...
---

Welcome! I'm up and running! First post.

Earlier this week, I put on my floaties and  abandoned the sinking ship that is the legal industry. I enrolled with the Spring 2017 cohort of [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](www.thisismetis.com/Chicago/Bootcamps) of Chicago.

I heard the words "data science" for the first time 2 years ago. I picked up my first [how-to-program book](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) 1.5 years ago. And, I watched my first [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) math-refresher video 1 year ago.  But I've done my research. Put in the time and hard work. So here I am. Wish me luck as I test the waters of data science.   

If all goes well with Metis, in 3 months my blog post will say...  
# "...and walks out a data scientist."
