title: A lawyer walks into a bootcamp...
---

I know when you look at me, a person with a J.D. from DePaul University College of Law and a B.A. in film-making from U.C. Berkeley, you don't automatically think data science, but hear me out!  

I have always had an affinity for storytelling, communication, and computers. As a filmmaker, I would lose track of time tinkering around on the computers crafting stories out of footage. Going to law school reinforced these affinities. I spent the majority of my legal career as a litigation support attorney, using optical character recognition, natural language processing, and data clustering software to analyze text.  While I was optimizing legal protections over electronic evidential data, I recognized the need to transition from the non-technical perspective to the technical.     

Data science is the next logical step.  Earlier this week, I enrolled with the Spring 2017 cohort of [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](www.thisismetis.com/Chicago/Bootcamps) of Chicago.

Wish me luck! If all goes well with metis, in 3 months my blog post will say...  
# "...and walks out a data scientist."
