title: The Art of Presenting 'Nothing'.

Week 3 done! ...Coping....  
It's been an emotional roller coaster (emotions which I shall try to convey with Shia LaBeouf's face).  

## Project 2: Predicting Film Success using Book Data.
###### Duration: 2 weeks  

###### Objective:  
To scrape our own data from websites and build a linear regression model to predict... something.  

 I chose to gamble on the relationship between books turned into films & the films based on these books. Specifically, I wanted to answer:  
 > "When a film is based on a book, do features of the book, such as
   * rating,  
   * number of reviews,   
   * date of publication,  
   * publisher information, and  
   * amazon rank,   

 > predict success of the film, specifically  
  * box office gross?"

###### Data:  
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home).   
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

###### Approach (& Shia's Face):
1.  I scraped, scraped, scraped, and scraped.    
For 1.5 weeks nearly nonstop.  My goal seemed so simple: Get what you can, work with what you got.  
  * (What is scraping? Behind every website is code. Inside the code is information. We essentially collected code, decoded around the information we wanted, and wrote our own code to get that information. Its tricky stuff.)
  * I ended up scraping:  
     - 200 pages of an IMDB search i created. Films ['based on novels'](http://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=based-on-novel&sort=moviemeter,asc&mode=detail&page=1&title_type=movie&ref_=kw_ref_typ).  
     - 1200 IMDB Literature pages, one for each of the films.  
     - 600 IMDB Business pages, one for each of films that had viable links to Amazon pages of the books they were based on.
     - 600 Amazon pages, of which 500 turned out usable.       
  * Yes. It was long & frustrating. But I couldn't look away!

2. Decipher, Code, & collect.
  The code I wrote to delicately pull all the information I needed was perhaps some of my best work so far.
    * I collected titles, release dates, IMDB IDs, & metacritic scores from 10,000 films.  
    * Using the IMDB IDs, I collected amazon links & box office gross from each of the films.  
    *  Using the Amazon links, I collected star ratings, number of reviews, publisher info, date of publication, & book rank.  
    * I was elated with the magic coming from my fingers!

3. Analyze the data & build a Linear Regression model.  
  * I found the P-Value for all my book features (P-Value tells me which features have a significant relationship with what I am trying to predict, film box office gross). I eliminated insignificant features.   
  * I created a 6 fold cross validation model. To fit my model on rotating portions of the data which served as the training set. and I tested the model on the remaining portion, my test set.
  * My best model turned out to be a Linear Regression with Ridge Regularization 6 Fold Cross Validation, which gave me an R-Squared score of... 0.075. (meaning that my model could only explain 7.5% of the variability in the film box office gross.)  
  * So what does this model predict?   
  ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Ridge_predictions.png)   
  NOTHING. Had the feature been more predictive, the dots would be congregated along the red line.  
  * It felt like giving birth... and hating your baby. Shia LaBeouf gets me.

###### Lesson Learned:  
So what do you present when you have 'nothing'? You present 'nothing' & 'next steps'! In data science, 'nothing' is something.
I presented my model and my findings. Then I followed up with next steps:  
  * I could collect more data!  
    * IMDB did not have Amazon links for older books, like 'The Hobbit', 'Pride & Prejudice', etc. The data showed a skew towards more recent books.  
    * IMDB's Amazon links also linked to older, less popular editions of books. For example, 'Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them' had a link to an edition with 4 reviews!! its other editions had 1,000s of reviews!  
  *  I could add more features! Like book sales!  
  *  I could look for other predictive relationships.  
    *  I think there could be an inverse relationship between books & films. Film success could be causing book sales to increase!   

So I learned a crucial lesson. **'Nothing' is only the beginning!**   
I know Shia. Duh, right?
