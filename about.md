Hola! I'm Jannie, former film-maker, Metis alum, attorney, and data scientist.  
  
### More Information  
  
Having spent my career as a litigation support attorney, using OCR and NLP-based software to analyze and optimize legal projections over electronic evidential data, I recognized the detriment of the archaic techno-phobic traditions of the legal industry.  In hopes of one day, liberating data from the confidential confines of outdated industries, I took the initiative to enroll at [Metis](www.thisismetis.com) to learn about the once elusive arts of data science.  I am consumed with using my analytical and communication skills to slay the three-headed hell hound of inefficiency, costliness, and intellectual stagnation. I also have a passion for story-telling. ;)
